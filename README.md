# smartFarming
In this project we design a smart greenhouse that can be controlled automatically as well as controlled by the user. 
This greenhouse has 3 rows of plants. A soil moisture sensor is used to detect the water requirement of plants in each row. 
If the soil moisture is low, the water valve corresponding to that row should be opened by the servo motor. 
The amount of valve opening of each row depends on the amount of soil moisture in that row, and the drier the soil, 
the more it should be opened. Also, the farmer must be able to control the valve of each row through the keypad. 
The smart greenhouse must be equipped with a fire detection and extinguishing system. 
we can use a flame sensor for this purpose.
If a fire is detected, the buzzer sounds and the valves must be fully opened for 5 seconds and then be closed.
